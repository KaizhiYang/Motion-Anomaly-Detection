## Overview

Object detection and tracking are essential computer vision tasks. This project employs YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to locate objects in each frame of a video stream. The detected objects are then tracked over time using DeepSORT (Deep Learning for Generic Object Tracking), providing a smooth and accurate tracking experience even in crowded scenes.
